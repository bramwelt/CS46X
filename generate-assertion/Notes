The user is 'logging in' to the directory provider

The Identity Assertion lasts for 1
month. This is the PGP key experation because that is how long the BIA
will be valid for in the Directory Provider. We do not trust the DirP,
so every item retrieved from it should be validated. This validation
will fail by Persona because the certificate will have expired.

We generate this BIA to simulate the user 'logging in' to the directory
provider. This requires a pre-made User Certificate from the user's IdP,
and the user's secret key to sign the BIA, and a PGP key that will be
generate for the user.
